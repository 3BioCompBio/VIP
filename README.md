# VIP

Here the python code relative to the paper "Calculating vertical ionization potentials of DNA stacks" M.Rooman and F. Pucci (submitted).

The usage is very simple, just clone the repository and run python vip.py, input the sequence of the nucleotide stack of any length and in output you will receive it vertical ionization potential.
